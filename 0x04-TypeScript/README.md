Write your code in the main.ts file:

Write an interface named Student that accepts the following elements: firstName(string), lastName(string), age(number), and location(string)
Create two students, and create an array named studentsList containing the two variables
Using Vanilla Javascript, render a table and for each elements in the array, append a new row to the table
Each row should contain the first name of the student and the location
Requirements:

Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

1. Let's build a Teacher interface
   mandatory
   Create a directory task_1 and copy these configuration files into this folder: package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

firstName(string) and lastName(string). These two attributes should only be modifiable when a Teacher is first initialized
fullTimeEmployee(boolean) this attribute should always be defined
yearsOfExperience(number) this attribute is optional
location(string) this attribute should always be defined
Add the possibility to add any attribute to the Object like contract(boolean) without specifying the name of the attribute

2. Extending the Teacher class
   mandatory

3. Printing teachers
   mandatory
   Write a function printTeacher:

It accepts two arguments firstName and lastName
It returns the first letter of the firstName and the full lastName
Example: printTeacher("John", "Doe") -> J. Doe
Write an interface for the function named printTeacherFunction.

4. Writing a class
   mandatory
   Write a Class named StudentClass:

The constructor accepts firstName(string) and lastName(string) arguments
The class has a method named workOnHomework that return the string Currently working
The class has a method named displayName. It returns the firstName of the student
The constructor of the class should be described through an Interface
The class should be described through an Interface
Requirements:

You can reuse the Webpack configuration from the previous exercise to compile the code.
When running npm run build, no TypeScript error should be displayed.
Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

5. Advanced types Part 1
   mandatory
   Create the DirectorInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:

workFromHome() returning a string
getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
workDirectorTasks() returning a string
Create the TeacherInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:

workFromHome() returning a string
getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
workTeacherTasks() returning a string
Create a class Director that will implement DirectorInterface

workFromHome should return the string Working from home
getToWork should return the string Getting a coffee break
workDirectorTasks should return the string Getting to director tasks
Create a class Teacher that will implement TeacherInterface

workFromHome should return the string Cannot work from home
getCoffeeBreak should return the string Cannot have a break
workTeacherTasks should return the string Getting to work
Create a function createEmployee with the following requirements:

It can return either a Director or a Teacher instance
It accepts 1 arguments:
salary(either number or string)
if salary is a number and less than 500 - It should return a new Teacher. Otherwise it should return a Director

6. Creating functions specific to employees
   mandatory
   Write a function isDirector:

it accepts employee as an argument
it will be used as a type predicate and if the employee is a director
Write a function executeWork:

it accepts employee as an argument
if the employee is a Director, it will call workDirectorTasks
if the employee is a Teacher, it will call workTeacherTasks

7. String literal types
   mandatory
   Write a String literal type named Subjects allowing a variable to have the value Math or History only. Write a function named teachClass:

it takes todayClass as an argument
it will return the string Teaching Math if todayClass is Math
it will return the string Teaching History if todayClass is History

8. Ambient Namespaces
   mandatory
   Create a directory called task_3 and copy these configuration files into it: package.json, webpack.config.js, tsconfig.json.

The first part of will require that you build an interface and a type. Inside a file named interface.ts:

Create a type RowID and set it equal to number
Create an interface RowElement that contains these 3 fields:
firstName: string
lastName: string
age?: number
You are building the next part of the application architecture. The goal is to save the entities to a database. Because of time constraints, you can’t write a connector to the database, and you decided to download a library called crud.js. Copy this file into the task_3/js directory.
Write an ambient file within task_3/js, named crud.d.ts containing the type declarations for each crud function. At the top of the file import RowID and RowElement from interface.ts.

In main.ts

At the top of the file create a triple slash directive that includes all the dependencies from crud.d.ts
Import the rowID type and rowElement from interface.ts
Import everything from crud.js as CRUD
Create an object called row with the type RowElement with the fields set to these values:

firstName: Guillaume
lastName: Salva
Create a const variable named newRowID with the type RowID and assign the value the insertRow command.

Next, create a const variable named updatedRow with the type RowElement and update row with an age field set to 23

Finally, call the updateRow and deleteRow commands.
Requirements:

When running npm run build, no TypeScript error should be displayed.
Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.
The main file and the ambient file should both import the types defined in the interface file.
You can easily test your ambient file by looking at the intellisense of your IDE when using the 3rd party functions.

9. Namespace & Declaration merging
   mandatory
   Create a new directory task_4 and copy the above tsconfig.json and put this package.json in there
   In task_4/js/subjects:

Create a file Teacher.ts and write a Teacher interface in a namespace named Subjects.

the interface requires firstName and lastName as string
Create a file Subject.ts and write a Subject class in the same namespace named Subjects.

the class has one attribute teacher that implements the Teacher interface
the class has one setter method setTeacher that accepts a teacher in argument (and as setter, set the instance attribute teacher with it)
Create a file Cpp.ts and make the following modifications in the same namespace.

Using declaration merging, add a new optional attribute experienceTeachingC (number) to the Teacher interface
Create a class Cpp extending from Subject
Write a method named getRequirements that will return a string Here is the list of requirements for Cpp
Write a method named getAvailableTeacher that will return a string Available Teacher: <first name of teacher>
If the teacher doesn’t have any experience in teaching C, then the method should return a string No available teacher
Create a file React.ts and write a React Class in the same namespace.

Add a new attribute experienceTeachingReact? (number) to the Teacher interface
In the class, write a method named getRequirements that will return a string Here is the list of requirements for React
Write a method named getAvailableTeacher that will return a string Available Teacher: <first name of teacher>
If the teacher doesn’t have any experience in teaching React, then the method should return a string No available teacher
Create a file Java.ts and write a Java Class in the same namespace.

Add a new attribute experienceTeachingJava? (number) to the Teacher interface
In the class, write a method named getRequirements that will return a string Here is the list of requirements for Java
Write a method named getAvailableTeacher that will return a string Available Teacher: <first name of teacher>
If the teacher doesn’t have any experience in teaching Java, then the method should return a string No available teacher

10. Update task_4/js/main.ts
    mandatory
    create and export a constant cpp for Cpp Subjects
    create and export a constant java for Java Subjects
    create and export a constant react for React Subjects
    create and export one Teacher object cTeacher with experienceTeachingC = 10
    for Cpp subject, log to the console C++, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher and print the strings they return
    for Java subject, log to the console Java, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher, and print the strings they return
    for React subject, log to the console React, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher, and print the strings they return

        11. Brand convention & Nominal typing

    mandatory
    Create a directory task_5 and copy these configuration files into the root of task_5: package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

Create two interfaces MajorCredits and MinorCredits in task_5/js/main.ts:

Each interface defines a number named credits
Add a brand property to each interface in order to uniquely identify each of them
Create two functions named sumMajorCredits and sumMinorCredits in task_5/js/main.ts:

Each function takes two arguments subject1 and subject2
sumMajorCredits returns MajorCredits value and sumMinorCredits returns MinorCredits value
Each function sums the credits of the two subjects
